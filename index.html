<h2 class="archive__subtitle">Project Overview</h2>

<h4>The AutoRally platform is a high-performance testbed for advanced perception and control research developed at Georgia Tech. The robot is integrated with ROS and designed as a fully contained system that requires no external sensing or computing. The robot allows researcher to explore high-speed, agressive off-road driving, which is a space typically open only to large groups with significant capital.</h4>
