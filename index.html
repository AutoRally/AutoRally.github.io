<h4>The AutoRally platform is a high-performance testbed for advanced perception and control research. The robot, developed at Georgia Tech, is integrated with ROS and designed as a self contained system that requires no external sensing or computing. The robot is a robust, cost-effective, and safe platform that opens the space of agressive autonomous off-road driving to all researchers.</h4>
