The AutoRally project began in 2011 to support a DURIP grant for vision-based high-speed autonomous navigation. The original platform was devloped by PhD student Brian Goldfain and Paul Drews, with help from masters student Rahul Ashok and supervision from professor James Rehg. A picture of the original AutoRally Platform is shown below. The first high-speed autonomous driving tests were conducted through a collaboration with PhD student Grady Williams, advised by Evanglos Theodorou, when his MPPI algorithm was ported to AutoRally and tasked with driving quickly around the oval GT-ARF track. This work led to the ICRA 2016 publication listed on the main project page.

Additional collaborations have resulted in the continued development and expansion of the AutoRally fleet to 6 vehicles at Georgia Tech. The fleet has supported the experimental results of numerous publications with collaborations from the labs of Panagiotis Tsiotras and Byron Boots.
