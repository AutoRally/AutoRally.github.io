The AutoRally project began in 2011 to support a DURIP grant for vision-based high-speed autonomous navigation. The original platform was devloped by PhD student Brian Goldfain and Paul Drews, with help from masters student Rahul Ashok and supervision from professor James Rehg. A picture of the original AutoRally Platform is shown below.

The first high-speed autonomous driving tests were conducted through a collaboration with PhD student Grady Williams, advised by Evanglos Theodorou, when his MPPI algorithm was ported to AutoRally and tasked with driving quickly around the oval GT-ARF track. This work led to the ICRA 2016 publication listed on the main project page. 

Over several iterations, AutoRally was refined to support a broad range of autonomous vehicle experiments with the supervision of Brian Goldfain. Additional PhD students who contributed to the design include Kamil Saigol and Marcus Pereira. A mostly complete list of undergraduates who contributed to the design include Cory Wacht, Matt Barulic, Orlin Velev, Sarah Selim, Dominic Pattison, Justin Zheng, Luis Pimentel, Alexandra Miner, and Jason Gibson. The current version of AutoRally is shown below.

Additional collaborations have resulted in the expansion of the AutoRally fleet to 6 vehicles at Georgia Tech. The fleet has supported the experimental results of numerous publications with collaborations from the labs of Panagiotis Tsiotras and Byron Boots.
