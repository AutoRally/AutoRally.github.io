# Build your own AutoRally Platform

The AutoRally platform can be constructed by a small team of non-pofessionals. Documentation is broken into a few parts, all of which are contained in a GitHub repository with all necessary supporting documents. The current platform with high-precision sensors and Mini-ITX form-factor compute box can be built and ready to run in about 80 hours. Total parts cost is less than $20,000.
