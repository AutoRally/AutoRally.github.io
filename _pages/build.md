# Build your own AutoRally Platform

The AutoRally platform can be constructed by a small team of non-pofessionals. Documentation is broken into a few parts, all of which are contained in a GitHub repository with all necessary supporting documents. The current platform with high-precision sensors and Mini-ITX form-factor compute box can be built and ready to run in about 80 hours. Total parts cost is less than $20,000.

  * Platform build instructions are available on Github <a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/autorally_platform_instructions/" data-style="mega" aria-label="AutoRally instructions on GitHub">View</a> <a class="github-button" href="https://github.com/AutoRally/autorally_platform_instructions/archive/master.zip" data-icon="octicon-cloud-download" data-style="mega" aria-label="Autorally instructions">Download</a> and include:
